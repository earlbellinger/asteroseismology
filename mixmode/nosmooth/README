Working with mesa/star

Make as many copies of this work directory as you'd like, name them
anything, and put them wherever you'd like.  It is a good idea
to keep your work directories outside of the mesa directory tree.
That will make your life better when you do a fresh checkout of a 
new mesa version at some point in the future.

Edit the 'inlist' file in work to redirect to read 'inlist_project'.
There are 3 places where you need to have the filename of the inlist:
      extra_star_job_inlist1_name = 'inlist_project'
      extra_controls_inlist1_name = 'inlist_project'
      extra_pgstar_inlist1_name = 'inlist_project'

You might want to rename 'inlist_project' to something more appropriate,
such as 'inlist_co_wd' or 'inlist_hot_jupiter' -- if you do, then
change the names in 'inlist' to match.

Make your work version of star by executing the 'mk' script.

   ./mk

   First, it compiles 3 files, placing output in your make directory:
   
      src/run_star_extras.f
      <MESA_DIR>/star/job/run_star.f
      src/run.f
   
   Then it links a lot of things to make your 'star' program.

Start your copy of mesa star by running the 'rn' script.

Remove the objects and the star program by running 'clean'.

Change parameters for star by editing inlist_project.
The full set of parameters and default values can be found in
the star/defaults directory -- see

	controls.defaults
	history_columns.list
	pgstar.defaults
	profile_columns.list
	star_job.defaults
   
If you'd like to call your program something other than 'star',
add a line at the top of your makefile defining the variable STAR.
E.g., add a line like this before the "include" line.
STAR = star_co_wd
Then the make will name the executable 'star_co_wd.
You'll need to edit your 'rn' and 're' scripts to match the new name.
